# Uncommon HTML Nesting Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error that causes unexpected layout problems. The issue arises from incorrectly nesting inline elements within block-level elements, leading to issues that aren't always immediately apparent.

## Description

The bug showcases how improper nesting of inline elements (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`) within block-level elements (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`) can result in visual inconsistencies and accessibility problems.  The error often goes undetected because it doesn't necessarily throw JavaScript errors. It manifests as unexpected rendering behavior.

## How to reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected layout or rendering issues. 

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.html`) demonstrates the correct way to nest inline elements within block-level elements, ensuring semantic correctness and preventing unexpected visual glitches. Review this corrected HTML for best practices.
