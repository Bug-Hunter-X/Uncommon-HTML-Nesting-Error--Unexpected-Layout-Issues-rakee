<p>The solution involves restructuring the HTML to ensure proper nesting of inline elements within block-level elements.  Instead of nesting inline elements within each other, you should place them at the appropriate level within the block-level structure.  Correcting the initial example will be like this:</p><code><p>This is a paragraph. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is bold text.</span> <a href="#">This is a link.</a></p></code><p>By separating the inline elements, the HTML structure is semantically correct and avoids the ambiguous nesting that can cause issues. This is clearer to the browser on how to display the content resulting in better accessibility and formatting.</p><p>Always ensure your HTML is well-structured and follows established best practices to avoid hidden bugs and ensure consistent rendering across different browsers and devices. </p>
